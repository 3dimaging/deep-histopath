\section{Discussion}
Discuss the issue of stride size for both training (via the preprocessed datasets), as well as prediction.  Particularly at prediction time, we don't know where the mitoses are, so a stride that is too large has the potential to miss the mitoses, while a very small stride incurs a high computational cost.  At training time, we also have to determine the ideal stride for the normal tissue.
